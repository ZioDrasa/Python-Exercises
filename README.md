# What's Going On In Ohio, Bruh? Let's Explain Ohio Memes
At the center of America is Ohio, not only geographically, but culturally as well. It's like if Breezewood, Pennsylvania was an entire state, comprised of fast food, gas stations and skinwalkers galore. It's no wonder why meme creators on TikTok, Twitter and elsewhere keep saying, "Only in Ohio" within their content.

The history of Ohio memes dates back much further than this most recent Can't Even X in Ohio trend, alluding to a stigma surrounding the Buckeye State that has been prevalent online since 2016 when Ohio vs. the world was a genuine threat.

Don't remember that trend? Don't worry, it's always been Ohioâ€¦ Let's explain how the state became a meme and how it represents the modern absurdism in America.
The online fascination with Ohio can be traced back to one Tumblr post from 2016 that showed a broken bus stop reading, "Ohio will be eliminated." The visual went instantly viral because, well, the idea was so funny. It had so much wiggle room, like, what had Ohio done? Why did it have to be eliminated? Some gave their reasons. Others showed contempt, stating, "it's for the best."
The image circulated the interwebs from Reddit to Twitter to Instagram, accumulating more Ohio-based memes that satirically labeled it as a threat. In 2019, the epitome of those memes landed online, being an MS-Paint drawing of two astronauts: one fully aware of Ohio's global reign, and the other dangerously blind to this truth.

This was the "Wait, it's all Ohio? Always has been" meme template, and it's trended in memes going into the 2020s. Even if the "two astronauts" format has become irrelevant, the stigma it created surrounding Ohio has stuck around to the present day.
